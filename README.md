This Power BI report is created for the NWU Tech Trends Benefit Realisation project to help stakeholders monitor and analyze important metrics related to client onboarding, project management, and cost savings. The report provides a summary of high-level metrics, project monitoring, and client insights, using live data connections and secure data management practices.

Report Structure
The report consists of the following pages:

High-Level Metrics: Provides a summary of total clients, total projects, and total cost savings.
Project Monitoring: Allows users to monitor cost and time savings per client and analyze projects over time.
Client Monitoring: Provides an overview of client distribution across regions, industries, and the onboarding timeline.
Data Sources
The report uses data from two primary sheets within the provided Excel file:

Clients sheet: Contains attributes such as business type, client ID, client name, country, industry, number of employees, onboarding date, and region.
Projects sheet: Contains attributes such as client ID, project ID, project description, project name, project technology, cost savings per month, time savings per month, and year and month.
Key Metrics and Visualizations
High-Level Metrics:
Total Clients: Displays the count of unique clients.
Total Projects: Displays the count of unique projects.
Total Cost Savings: Calculates the total yearly cost savings by multiplying monthly savings by 12 and summing across all projects.
Project Monitoring:
Savings per Client: A visual representation of savings accumulated by each client.
Savings Over Time: A time-series visual showing cost and time savings per month or year across all projects.
Project Breakdown: A count of projects, including technology and description insights.
Client Monitoring:
Client Distribution: A map or chart showing client distribution by region or country.
Client Onboarding Timeline: Visualization of when clients were onboarded based on the Onboarding Date field.

Filters
The report includes several filters that can be applied across all pages:

Filter by Project: Allows users to filter visuals based on specific projects.
Filter by Client: Filters report based on selected clients.
Filter by Date Range: Users can filter by a specified date range for more focused analysis of time-sensitive data.

AI Features
The following AI features are incorporated into the report:

Smart Narrative: A textual summary of key insights is automatically generated based on the data visualizations.
Decomposition Tree: Enables users to drill down into the components of a metric like total savings to see how different factors (e.g., project type, technology) contribute to the overall result.
Anomaly Detection: Automatically highlights any unusual trends or anomalies in savings or project-related metrics.

How to Use the Report
High-Level Metrics: Navigate to the "High-Level Metrics" page to get a quick overview of the number of clients, projects, and the total cost savings.
Project Monitoring: Use the "Project Monitoring" page to track cost and time savings, and monitor projects over time.
Client Monitoring: On the "Client Monitoring" page, explore the distribution and onboarding of clients and monitor their status over different regions.
Filters: Use the filters provided on each page to customize the data being viewed. You can filter by client, project, and date range to focus on specific insights.
AI Features: Explore the smart narrative, decomposition tree, and anomaly detection features to get additional insights that may not be immediately apparent from visualizations alone.
